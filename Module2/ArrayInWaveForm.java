/*
Let me introduce you to John, who loves to play with numbers. One day, he was given an unsorted array of integers and was challenged to transform it into a wave-like array. John found it interesting and decided to take up the challenge.

Help John by sorting the array into a wave like array. An array arr[0..n-1] is sorted in wave form if

arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= â€¦..

Input Format

First line take an integer input from user as N , where N is the size of array.

Second line takes N elements as non-negative integers input in array.

Constraints

1<=n<=100

1<=arr[i]<=10^4
Output Format

Return the array in sorted wave form.

Sample Input 0

7
10 90 49 2 1 5 23
Sample Output 0

2 1 10 5 49 23 90
